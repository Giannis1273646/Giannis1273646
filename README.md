### Hi there 👋
I'm a dedicated senior student at the University of Peloponnese, about to graduate with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My journey has been fueled by a passion for creating applications that seamlessly handle data and bring user interactions to life.

💻 I am proficient in Java and specialize in building applications that allow users to upload and process data directly from databases. As a soon-to-be graduate, I am eager to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, contribute to projects, and collaborate with innovative minds.

🎓 Anticipating the culmination of my academic journey this year, I am ready to transition into the professional word, armed with a solid foundation and a hunger for continuous learning.

🌐 Actively seeking opportunities to make a meaningful impact, I am open to internships and collaborations that foster growth and creativity.

Let's connect, code, and make the most of this exciting journey! 💡
